# huskytesting_tree_dashboard

Each folder in this repository houses a file containing the information for a phylogenetic tree. The tree includes all sequenced HCT samples collected within the corresponding timeframe. Also included are a subsample of genomes for SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in Washington during the same timeframe.

To view the tree, download the .json file, open the https://auspice.us webpage, and drag and drop the .json file on this page. Once the tree opens, click on the "Color by" drop down menu and select "hct" to view the hct genomes in the tree.
